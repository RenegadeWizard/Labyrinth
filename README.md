## How it works

There are five mazes to choose from. The game starts when you choose one of them. You can move by using the keyboard: 2(UP), 4 (LEFT), 6 (RIGHT) and 5 or 8 (DOWN).
The game ends when you find the exit. You are placed in the rank with a nick of your choosing. The rank is available on a website in plain text.
